# Electron React : Tic-Tac-Toe

Trying to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game from the [official React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) using the  [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) as a template.

## Node version

Does not work with v4.x.
Only tested with v6.9.3 for now.

## How to run
```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```
